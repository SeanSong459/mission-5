This project, which is part of Mission Ready's Advanced Software Development course, aims to enhance user experience on the Turners Car website. Together with another UX designer, I created this insurance page and form page in just one week.

Highlights include a multi-step form that uses Formik and Stepper, Yup for validation, Google authentication, and Firestore for the database.
